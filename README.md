# Naive-Bayes-classification-Salary-data
This repository contains my Naive Bayes classification  assignment for Data Science. I've implemented a Naive-Bayes-classification model in Python to predict the target variable . The dataset used for training and testing the model is Kaggle Salary-data dataset. Feel free to explore the code and the results in the Jupyter Notebook provided.
